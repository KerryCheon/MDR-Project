# Column Misalignment Issue - Resolution Summary

## Issue Description
Column indices 11–12 were previously missing from the configuration, causing subsequent columns to be shifted and incorrectly aligned with the actual USCRN data.

## Resolution

### 1. Verified Current Configuration
The current `config.yaml` correctly defines all 28 USCRN daily01 columns (indices 0-27):
- ✅ Column 11: `sur_temp_type` (SUR_TEMP_DAILY_TYPE)
- ✅ Column 12: `sur_temp_max` (SUR_TEMP_DAILY_MAX)
- ✅ All other columns properly mapped

### 2. Added Comprehensive Documentation
- **config.yaml**: Added detailed comments for all 28 columns, including descriptions and units
- **USCRN_SCHEMA.md**: Created comprehensive documentation of the USCRN daily01 format with a complete column reference table

### 3. Created Validation Test
- **tests/schema_test.py**: Automated test that validates:
  - All 28 columns (0-27) are mapped in config.yaml
  - Column names match the expected USCRN schema
  - Critical columns 11-12 are properly defined
  - Actual data files have the expected 28-column structure

### 4. Verified Data Pipeline
- Tested ParsePipe with actual USCRN data files
- Confirmed columns 11-12 contain correct data:
  - `sur_temp_type`: Contains 'R', 'C', 'U' sensor type indicators
  - `sur_temp_max`: Contains surface temperature values in °C
- No column misalignment detected

## Prevention Measures

### Regular Validation
Run the schema validation test to detect any future misalignment:
```bash
cd Pipeline
python3 tests/schema_test.py
```

### Documentation
Refer to `USCRN_SCHEMA.md` for the official column mapping when making changes to the configuration.

### Configuration Guidelines
⚠️ **Important**: All 28 columns must be defined in `config.yaml`. Removing or commenting out any column will cause misalignment for all subsequent columns.

## Test Results

### Schema Validation Test
```
✓ PASS - All 28 columns (0-27) mapped in config.yaml
✓ PASS - All column names match expected USCRN schema
✓ PASS - Columns 11-12 correctly defined
✓ PASS - Actual data files have expected 28 columns
```

### Parse Pipeline Test
```
✓ PASS - Parsed 6,655 rows from USCRN data
✓ PASS - Column 'sur_temp_type' present with correct values
✓ PASS - Column 'sur_temp_max' present with correct values
✓ PASS - No column misalignment detected
```

## Conclusion
The column alignment issue has been verified as resolved. All 28 USCRN columns are correctly mapped in the configuration, with columns 11-12 properly defined as `sur_temp_type` and `sur_temp_max`. Comprehensive documentation and validation tests have been added to prevent future misalignment issues.
